    <h2 style="text-align: left;">M. Cookies.</h2>
  
    <p>Our website uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of 
    letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored 
    by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser 
    requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or 
    “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will 
    remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry 
    date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, 
    when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information 
    that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you 
    may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. {SELECT 
    ACCURATE PHRASING We use only session cookies / only persistent cookies / both 
    session and persistent cookies on our website.}</p>
  
    <p>1. The names of the cookies that we use on our website, and the purposes for 
    which they are used, are set out below:</p>
  
    <p>a. we use Google Analytics and Adwords on our website to recognize a 
    computer when a user {INCLUDE ALL USES THAT COOKIES ARE USED 
    FOR ON YOUR SITE visits the website / track users as they navigate the 
    website / enable the use of a shopping cart on the website / improve the 
    website’s usability / analyze the use of the website / administer the 
    website / prevent fraud and improve the security of the website / 
    personalize the website for each user / target advertisements which may 
    be of particular interest to specific users / describe purpose(s)};</p>
  
    <p>2. Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies—for example:</p>
  
    <p>a. in Internet Explorer (version 10) you can block cookies using the 
    cookie handling override settings available by clicking “Tools,” 
    “Internet Options,” “Privacy,” and then “Advanced”;</p>
  
    <p>b. in Firefox (version 24) you can block all cookies by clicking “Tools,” 
    “Options,” “Privacy,” selecting “Use custom settings for history” from 
    the drop-down menu, and unticking “Accept cookies from sites”; and</p>
  
    <p>c. in Chrome (version 29), you can block all cookies by accessing the 
    “Customize and control” menu, and clicking “Settings,” “Show 
    advanced settings,” and “Content settings,” and then selecting “Block 
    sites from setting any data” under the “Cookies” heading.
    Blocking all cookies will have a negative impact upon the usability of many 
    websites. If you block cookies, you will not be able to use all the features on our 
    website.</p>
  
    <p>3. You can delete cookies already stored on your computer—for example:</p>
  
    <p>a. in Internet Explorer (version 10), you must manually delete cookie 
    files (you can find instructions for doing so 
    at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/278835 );</p>
  
    <p>b. in Firefox (version 24), you can delete cookies by clicking “Tools,” 
    “Options,” and “Privacy”, then selecting “Use custom settings for 
    history”, clicking “Show Cookies,” and then clicking “Remove All 
    Cookies”; and</p>
  
    <p>c. in Chrome (version 29), you can delete all cookies by accessing the 
    “Customize and control” menu, and clicking “Settings,” “Show 
    advanced settings,” and “Clear browsing data,” and then selecting 
    “Delete cookies and other site and plug-in data” before clicking “Clear 
    browsing data.”</p>
  
    <p>4. Deleting cookies will have a negative impact on the usability of many 
    websites</p>
