  requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or 
  “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will 
  remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry 
  date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, 
  when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information 
  that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you 
  may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. {SELECT
